Presented in the order I'd recommend learning about the topic of neuromorphic.

# Electrical Engineering

- Memristors are a type of electronic engineering. It's not used in the doc (yet) but I believe a basic background on circuitry helps recognize the memristor and neuromorphic system as a brand new and fundamentally different technology relative to processors of current computers.

# CMOS

- This is relevant given that neuromorphic systems rely primarily on the memristor. CMOS is the foundation of logic gates which are primarily used in Von Neumann Architecture. Neuromorphic systems and memristors do not use logic gates (not nearly as much) given their machine learning niche and how they manipulate electronic currents.
