**Resources**

Presented in the order I'd recommend learning about the topic of neuromorphic. Each sub topic is sorted by importance, top to bottom.
Ideally you should only to read the first two resources to get an understanding of that topic and moving on.

# AI
AI is a massive field. Ai is a superset of machine learning. Machine learning is a superset of neural networks. So on and so forth. A good understanding of AI predicates a good understanding of neuromorphic.

# MACHINE LEARNING
Neuromorphic computing is, essentially, the physical implementation of neural networks. Neural networks themselves a subset of machine learning.

# NEUROMORPHIC
A neuromorphic chip or computer is any device that uses physical artifical neurons. However, as of recently, this definition has developed cover any analog or neural systems.

# Electrical Engineering + Analog and Digital
There are several things in electrical engineering that enhances your understanding of neuromorphic. Any electrical component, memristors and synaptic transistors for example, that are analog rather than digital, are useful in neuromorphic archetecture. An understanding of digital and analog empowers your understanding of artificial neurons.

# SYNAPTIC TRANSISTORS
- This is one of Hersam's developmental focuses. Neuromorphic is, originally, a computer archetecture innovation rather than all computing that is akin to the brain. IBM's Neuromorphic page mentions something similar to Synaptic Transistors. All in all it's just another artificial neuron type deal.

# MEMRISTORS
- Neurmorphic computing was originally a term for computer archetecture that used artificial neurons. Memristors are an electrical component that is suited for the analog electrical flow of "information".

# CMOS
CMOS is a term for the standardized logic gates used in all computers. The term comes up in neuromorphic from time to time but it is not mutually exclusive with neuromorphic engineering. Neuromorphic computers such as Loihi use CMOS in its archetecture.

# CPUs GPUs NPUs and Parallel Processing
Von Neumann and parallel processing are relevant but not super important for understanding neuromorphic. This is more of a general AI thing.
