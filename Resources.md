Presented in the order I'd recommend learning about the topic of neuromorphic.

# Electrical Engineering

- Memristors are an electrical component like transistors, capacitors, resistors, etc. CMOS is primarily composed of the latter things while memristors are best served in neuromorphic chips dedicated to simulating leaky fire and forget artifical neurons.

# CMOS

- CMOS is a term for the standardized logic gates used in all computers. Non-temporal and generally best suited for boolean logic, a neuromorphic chip is likely supplemented by CMOS components for interfacing with a greater computer.

- Intel's loihi chip is a neuromorphic computer but i'm starting to notice an odd trend where all of the strongest neuromorphic chips are just traditional computers that are specialized in simulating SNNs.
