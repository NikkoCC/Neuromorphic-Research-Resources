Presented in the order I'd recommend learning about the topic of neuromorphic. Each sub topic is sorted by importance, top to bottom.

# Electrical Engineering

- Memristors are an electrical component like transistors, capacitors, resistors, etc. CMOS is primarily composed of the latter things while memristors are best served in neuromorphic chips dedicated to simulating leaky fire and forget artifical neurons.

- Covers the purpose of using parallelism for AI.

# CMOS
- CMOS is a term for the standardized logic gates used in all computers. Non-temporal and generally best suited for boolean logic, a neuromorphic chip is likely supplemented by CMOS components for interfacing with a greater computer.

# Binary
- Naturally, as most computers today are founded on binary hardware and software, this topic sees relevancy. Neuromorphic hardware and software isn't binary or instruction based. Most large neurmorphic computers may be based on CMOS but they are dedicated to simulating spike/event based computation rather than the typical "on/off" states.

# NEUROMORPHIC
- A neuromorphic chip or computer is any device that uses physical artifical neurons. However, as of recently, this definition has developed cover any analog or neural systems.

- Intel's loihi chip is a neuromorphic computer. Though it uses "neurocores" which are presumably a processor, these processors fufill the role of a physical artifical neuron and the software involved a form of neural network.
